# 📚 Decentralized Content Library

Welcome to the Decentralized Content Library (DCL), a Web3 platform built on the Stacks blockchain that empowers creators with fair compensation while providing users open access to diverse content. This project tackles the real-world problem of unfair revenue sharing on centralized platforms like YouTube or Spotify, where algorithms and middlemen siphon off earnings. Instead, DCL uses smart contracts to ensure transparent, automated payouts, royalties, and community governance—putting control back in the hands of creators and users.

## ✨ Features

🔗 Upload and store content metadata immutably on-chain  
💰 Set custom pricing, royalties, and subscription models for fair compensation  
📈 Automatic royalty distribution on every access or resale  
🗳️ Community governance for platform decisions  
⚖️ Built-in dispute resolution for content claims  
🔒 Secure access control to prevent unauthorized viewing  
📊 Track views, earnings, and analytics transparently  
🚫 Anti-censorship design with decentralized storage integration (e.g., IPFS)  

## 🛠 How It Works

DCL leverages 8 smart contracts written in Clarity to create a robust, modular system. Creators upload content hashes (linked to off-chain storage like IPFS), set terms, and earn directly from users via the platform's native token. Users browse, pay for access, and participate in governance. All transactions are handled on-chain for trustless execution.

**For Creators**  
- Register your profile via the UserManagement contract.  
- Upload content details (hash, title, description, price/royalty rates) using ContentRegistry.  
- Define access rules in AccessControl (e.g., one-time fee, subscription, or free with ads).  
- Earnings are auto-distributed by RoyaltyDistributor on user interactions.  
- Propose changes or resolve disputes through Governance and DisputeResolution.  

**For Users**  
- Browse registered content and pay via Token contract.  
- Subscribe for recurring access using Subscription.  
- Verify content ownership and view analytics.  
- Vote on platform upgrades to influence fees or features.  

That's it! Deploy on Stacks, integrate with IPFS for storage, and build a fairer ecosystem for content creation.
